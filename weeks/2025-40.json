eliminating unsafe code: type-safe wait functions ([#130](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-uring/pull/130)), safer file descriptor wizardry ([#129](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-uring/pull/129)), and handling `AT_FDCWD` in C to eliminate `Obj.magic` ([#128](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-uring/pull/128))\n- [David Allsopp](https://github.com/dra27) proposed **type-safe wait functions** as a more invasive alternative to address issue [#117](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-uring/issues/117), ensuring OCaml ints only represent actual integers rather than encoded values, with no allocation difference for the fast path and no cost for retrieving `Unix.file_descr` values from syscalls returning descriptors ([#130](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-uring/pull/130))\n- Design discussion emerged around **file descriptor abstraction** between [David Allsopp](https://github.com/dra27) and [Anil Madhavapeddy](https://github.com/avsm) exploring whether file descriptors should be treated as abstract types rather than integers, with [Thomas Leonard](https://github.com/talex5) noting similarities to Eio's existing approach in [ocaml-multicore/eio](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio) ([#130](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-uring/pull/130))\n- Alternative approach in [#129](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-uring/pull/129) provides simpler solution to [#117](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-uring/issues/117) at the cost of an extra C call, currently on hold pending resolution of design discussion in [#130](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-uring/pull/130)", "discussions_summary": "Design debate on treating file descriptors as abstract types versus integers across platforms", "notable_discussions": "- **File descriptor type safety** discussion exploring whether OCaml file descriptors should be abstract types, with [David Allsopp](https://github.com/dra27) noting that while file descriptors are integers on *nix systems, they're not on Windows, and questioning when direct integer access is truly necessary beyond process spawning ([#130](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-uring/pull/130))\n- Platform-specific considerations examined with [David Allsopp](https://github.com/dra27) clarifying that OCaml file descriptors are not integers on Windows though C ones are, while OS-level Windows descriptors are pointers, suggesting `type unix_fd = private int` as a potential solution for Linux-only code like ocaml-uring ([#130](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-uring/pull/130))\n- Potential for **Windows support** raised by [David Allsopp](https://github.com/dra27) noting similarities between
