relocatability improvements, and atomic record fields support", "new_features_summary": "New String predicates, external types documentation, relocatable ld.conf, native dynlink cleanup, debugger

([#14362](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/14362))\n- Implemented **atomic record fields** enabling lock-free concurrent programming with per-field atomic operations ([#13404](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/13404))\n- Enhanced **native dynlink** to call `dlclose` on dynamically loaded objects when errors occur, preventing resource leaks ([#14391](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/14391))\n- Improved **debugger error messages** to display specific information about incorrect or missing magic numbers rather than generic errors ([#14375](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/14375))\n- Introduced **relocatable OCaml installations** with explicit relative paths in `ld.conf` - paths like `.` and `..` now resolve relative to the ld.conf directory, and the default ld.conf uses relative rather than absolute paths ([#14243](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/14243))\n- Added **--with-additional-stublibsdir** configure option to prepend custom directories to ld.conf, and stublibs subdirectory is no longer created when building with --disable-shared ([#14243](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/14243))\n- Implemented **multiple ld.conf loading** - the runtime now loads from all of $OCAMLLIB/ld.conf, $CAMLLIB/ld.conf, and standard_library_default/ld.conf rather than just the first found ([#14243](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/14243))\n- Added **external types documentation** - new manual chapter explaining external types for FFI-populated values with examples for predefined types like float, string, and array ([#13994](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/13994))\n- Updated **GADT tutorial** in manual to avoid using abstract types as indices, demonstrating proper usage with external types ([#13994](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/13994))\n- Enhanced **ld.conf parsing** robustness - now handles CRLF line endings consistently on both Windows and Unix, and ocamlc uses the same C primitive-based parser as the runtime ([#14243](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/14243))\n- Documented **Ptype_external** in parsetree.mli to clarify the AST representation of

([#59](https://github.com/ocaml/RFCs/pull/59))\n- **Scoping semantics for `val` bindings** discussed with [Kate](https://github.com/kit-ty-kate) proposing that forward declarations should be removed

Scherer](https://github.com/gasche) proposing syntax to write type signatures alongside definitions, similar to Haskell-style type annotations, sparking extensive discussion about forward declarations, scoping semantics, and integration with mutual recursion ([ocaml/RFCs#59](https://github.com/ocaml/RFCs/pull/59))\n- **Tuple projections RFC** continues with active debate between [Alistair](https://github.com/johnyob) and maintainers about whether unlabeled numeric projections should require tuple polymorphism or rely on known type information, with consensus favoring polymorphic approach for unlabeled projections ([ocaml/RFCs#57](https://github.com/ocaml/RFCs/pull/57))\n- **Atomic record fields RFC** updated with note about atomic arrays implementation, cross-referencing [ocaml/ocaml#14380](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/14380) ([ocaml/RFCs#39](https://github.com/ocaml/RFCs/pull/39))", "cross_repository_work": "- **Atomic record fields**

[ocaml/ocaml#14388](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/14388)", "notable_discussions": "- **Forward declarations vs. type ascriptions** debated extensively for val declarations RFC, with [Jeremy Yallop](https://github.com/yallop) proposing an alternative interpretation where `val` serves as forward declarations to introduce recursion (similar to Agda), enabling recursive bindings between different kinds of items like types and modules, while [Gabriel Scherer](https://github.com/gasche) proposed that `val` should primarily serve as type ascriptions that don't introduce recursion ([ocaml/RFCs#59](https://github.com/ocaml/RFCs/pull/59))\n- **Scoping semantics for val bindings** discussed with [Kate](https://github.com/kit-ty-kate) proposing that forward declarations should be removed from scope in the next definition to avoid unintended recursive references, while others debated whether this creates confusing semantics ([ocaml/RFCs#59](https://github.com/ocaml/RFCs/pull/59))\n- **Syntax placement preferences** emerged with [Xavier Leroy](https://github.com/xavierleroy) advocating for `val` declarations to immediately precede their corresponding `let` or `and` bindings rather than being grouped at the top, viewing this as syntactic sugar for type constraints that improves code legibility ([ocaml/RFCs#59](https://github.com/ocaml/RFCs/pull/59))\n- **Alternative syntaxes** proposed including [Leo White](https://github.com/lpw25)'s `val rec` keyword to explicitly mark forward declarations that introduce recursion, and [Richard Eisenberg](https://github.com/goldfirere)'s unordered `and`-joined blocks mixing `val`, `let`, and `let rec` declarations ([ocaml/RFCs#59](https://github.com/ocaml/RFCs/pull/59))\n- **Locally abstract types in signatures** questioned by [Richard Eisenberg](https://github.com/goldfirere) regarding scoping across `val` and `let` boundaries, expressing concerns about \"spooky action at a distance\" similar to Haskell's deprecated `-XScopedTypeVariables` extension ([ocaml/RFCs#59](https://github.com/ocaml/RFCs/pull/59))\n- **Tuple polymorphism implementation challenges** raised by [Chris Casinghino](https://github.com/ccasin) questioning how runtime projection would work for flexible tuples with labeled and unlabeled fields, asking whether canonical ordering or dynamic lookup would be required ([ocaml/RFCs#57](https://github.com/ocaml/RFCs/pull/57))\n- **Type inference complexity** debated with [Alistair](https://github.com/johnyob) arguing that tuple polymorphism would be invasive to the type checker and preferring improvements to known-type-information propagation instead, while maintainers indicated numeric projections without polymorphism are non-intuitive ([ocaml/RFCs#57](https://github.com/ocaml/RFCs/pull/57))\n- **String module enhancement proposal** by [Daniel Bünzli](https://github.com/dbuenzli) discussing comprehensive improvements to the String API, which led to merged PRs [ocaml/ocaml#14362](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/14362) and ongoing work in [ocaml/ocaml#14381](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/14381)

improvements via [ocaml/ocaml#14241](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/14241) making the compiler more helpful and approachable\n- **Type system expressiveness** features gaining momentum with proposals for `val` declarations in [ocaml/RFCs#59](https://github.com/ocaml/RFCs/pull/59), tuple projections in [ocaml/RFCs#57](https://github.com/ocaml/RFCs/pull/57), and atomic record fields in [ocaml/RFCs#39](https://github.com/ocaml/RFCs/pull/39) all aiming to make OCaml's type system more expressive while maintaining backward compatibility and ergonomic syntax\n- **Governance transparency** improvements formalized with the conflict-of-interest policy in [ocaml/RFCs#55](https://github.com/ocaml/RFCs/pull/55) reflecting the committee's effort to balance community representation while being explicit about institutional affiliations and potential biases\n- **Documentation completeness** addressing gaps in manual coverage of language features, particularly around
