modules ([#14362](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/14362))\n- Implemented **atomic record fields** enabling lock-free concurrent programming with per-field atomic operations ([#13404](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/13404))\n- Enhanced **native dynlink** to call `dlclose` on dynamically loaded objects when errors occur, preventing resource leaks ([#14391](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/14391))\n- Improved **debugger error messages** to display specific information about incorrect or missing magic numbers rather than generic errors ([#14375](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/14375))\n- Introduced **relocatable OCaml installations** with explicit relative paths in `ld.conf` - paths like `.` and `..` now resolve relative to the ld.conf directory, and the default ld.conf uses relative rather than absolute paths ([#14243](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/14243))\n- Added **--with-additional-stublibsdir** configure option to prepend custom directories to ld.conf, and stublibs subdirectory is no longer created when building with --disable-shared ([#14243](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/14243))\n- Implemented **multiple ld.conf loading** - the runtime now loads from all of $OCAMLLIB/ld.conf, $CAMLLIB/ld.conf, and standard_library_default/ld.conf rather than just the first found ([#14243](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/14243))\n- Added **external types documentation** - new manual chapter explaining external types for FFI-populated values with examples for predefined types like float, string, and array ([#13994](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/13994))\n- Updated **GADT tutorial** in manual to avoid using abstract types as indices, demonstrating proper usage with external types ([#13994](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/13994))\n- Enhanced **ld.conf parsing** robustness - now handles CRLF line endings consistently on both Windows and Unix, and ocamlc uses the same C primitive-based parser as the runtime ([#14243](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/14243))\n- Documented **Ptype_external** in parsetree.mli to clarify the AST representation of

different kinds of items like types and modules, while [Gabriel Scherer](https://github.com/gasche) proposed that `val` should primarily serve as type ascriptions that don't introduce recursion ([#59](https://github.com/ocaml/RFCs/pull/59))\n- **Scoping semantics for `val` bindings** discussed with [Kate](https://github.com/kit-ty-kate) proposing that forward declarations should be removed from scope in the next definition to avoid unintended recursive references, while others debated whether this creates confusing semantics ([#59](https://github.com/ocaml/RFCs/pull/59))\n- **Syntax placement preferences** emerged with [Xavier Leroy](https://github.com/xavierleroy) advocating for `val` declarations to immediately precede their corresponding `let` or `and` bindings rather than

including [Leo White](https://github.com/lpw25)'s `val rec` keyword to explicitly mark forward declarations that introduce recursion, and [Richard Eisenberg](https://github.com/goldfirere)'s unordered

how runtime projection would work for flexible tuples with labeled and unlabeled fields, asking whether canonical ordering or dynamic lookup would be required ([#57](https://github.com/ocaml/RFCs/pull/57))\n- **Type inference complexity** debated with [Alistair](https://github.com/johnyob) arguing that tuple polymorphism would be invasive to the type

`-I-manifest` and `-H-manifest` parameters (determined unnecessary for Merlin after discussion with [Andrei Odintsov](https://github.com/Forestryks)), resolving conflicts from parameterized module changes, and fixing type errors introduced by lazy type representation improvements\n- Addressed **breaking changes** from multiple upstream OCaml PRs including handling `.cms` file generation for stdlib (previously only `.cmt` files existed), requiring prioritization order changes from `.cmsi > .cms > .cmti > .cmt` to properly prioritize `.cmti` files for documentation\n- Updated **mode system** and **closure lock** handling throughout the type checker, including refactored `add_escape_lock`, `add_share_lock`, and `add_closure_lock` functions with revised `Mode.Hint.pinpoint` parameters\n- Enhanced **jkind subsumption checking** by adding `level` parameter to `Layout.sub` function for improved type level tracking during unification\n- Improved **error reporting** functions in `Env` and `Jkind.Violation` modules by adding `level` parameter to `report_error`, `report_lookup_error`, `report_with_offender`, and related functions for better diagnostic context\n- Refactored **type marking infrastructure** in `Btype` module, replacing `unmark_iterators` with more flexible `type_iterators` that take `type_mark` parameter, and adding distinction between `type_iterators_full` and `type_iterators_without_type_expr`\n- Updated test suite across multiple files including `function-recovery.t`, `mode-recovery.t`, `parameters.t`, `type-enclosing`, and

support including hover capabilities and expanded formatting functions, making the advanced type system more accessible to developers\n- **SIMD type support expansion** with addition of float16 variants completing the SIMD type coverage across different vector widths (128-bit, 256-bit, and 512-bit)\n- **Mode system refinement** showing consolidation of various lock mechanisms (`escape_lock`, `share_lock`, `closure_lock`) under unified `Mode.Hint.pinpoint` abstraction for tracking mode constraints\n- **Type-level performance optimization** through strategic laziness in type operations,
