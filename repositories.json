without rebuilding, introducing `--with-relative-libdir` configure option to locate Standard Library relative to compiler binaries, adding `-runtime-search` option for bytecode executables to search

magic numbers from upstream OCaml flambda configuration ([#108](https://github.com/oxcaml/merlin/issues/108))\n- Fixed **EXCLUDE_QUERY_DIR directive** handling for cmt/cms files, ensuring proper directory exclusion behavior during indexing ([#104](https://github.com/oxcaml/merlin/issues/104))\n- Improved **ghost location handling** in occurrences query by switching from ghost location
