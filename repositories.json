overriding context inference ([#91](https://github.com/oxcaml/merlin/issues/91))\n- New **magic numbers update script** (`update-magic-numbers.sh`) for automated OCaml version compatibility maintenance, automatically syncing magic numbers from upstream OCaml flambda configuration ([#108](https://github.com/oxcaml/merlin/issues/108))\n- Fixed **EXCLUDE_QUERY_DIR directive** handling for cmt/cms files, ensuring proper directory exclusion behavior during indexing ([#104](https://github.com/oxcaml/merlin/issues/104))\n- Improved **ghost location handling** in occurrences query by

Stevenson](https://github.com/liam923) adding flexible context override capability for precise namespace searches, enabling users to specify exact identifier search contexts rather than relying on position inference ([#91](https://github.com/oxcaml/merlin/issues/91))\n- **OCaml 5.2.0minus-1 integration** delivered through comprehensive upstream merge by [Liam Stevenson](https://github.com/liam923), bringing latest flambda backend changes while temporarily deferring parameterized module support ([#106](https://github.com/oxcaml/merlin/issues/106))\n- **Development tooling improved** with new automated magic numbers update script by [Liam Stevenson](https://github.com/liam923), streamlining OCaml version compatibility maintenance with validation and error checking ([#108](https://github.com/oxcaml/merlin/issues/108))\n- **Code cleanup completed** by [Liam Stevenson](https://github.com/liam923) removing unused magic numbers from configuration,
